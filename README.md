# Text Summarization  

## 🚀 Overview  

**Text Summarization** is a Python-based project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to summarize text data efficiently. Whether you're handling articles, reports, or large textual documents, this tool simplifies and extracts the core content, saving time and effort.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- **Automated Summarization:** Extracts the most relevant sentences from the input text.  
- **Flexible Input:** Summarize any plain text, documents, or strings of data.  
- **Customizable:** Allows tuning the summarization parameters for optimal results.  
- **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use functions designed for both beginners and experts in NLP.
